## Run Details

### The Plan

### Participants
* [Alabama the Shark](../../characters/alabama) (Todd)
* Espinoz the Junker (Matt)
* Schlep the Feral (Michael)
* Dr. Half the Leftover (Scott)

### Stream of Consciousness Notes, From Todd

#### Plot One

* We are going to the island of Blue Angel, starting on the shore.
* We got some advice to find Pinker, who will tell us the safe path.
* Pinker the Ferryman.
* **Rumor**: One member of Sandy Shores is a security risk.
* **Rumor**: The Asphalt Jacks have a new cannibal target they are taking to "The Diner".
* Arkinsaw the Hermit is our informant.
* We want to take tequila and other supplies to trade for toys that we are going to give to the Monarchs (so they can give them to the children of their human slaves).
* Engagement was a Success. Some people take us on their boat.
* The big red junk with green sails is a diner and brothel.
* We eventually got to the merchants on the island and traded 6 of our supplies and a tech-2 trinket for 10 supply point of fine toys for the Monarchs.

#### Plot Two

Separately...

* There is some drama at the Dirty Drink. Schlep is there.
* The Jacks and the Monarchs are there.
* Alabama is not involved.
* We bartered with the Monarchs and gained 10 supply. That advances us to a Tier 1 faction!


### Post-game Summary, From Dan

The rescue of Westchester made the Jacks look like fools. Took tequila payment to Ash Lords without any issues. Do you want to ally with the Ash Lords? Aquired luxury items for Monarchs from the island shops but smuggled them out to avoid "customs and taxes."  This may have  upset some new faction. 
 

## After the Run

### Fallout

An Island mercenary with an Ape Nation escort is sent by the Pirate Lords to extort PCs into a job against Blacksands or Hightower. Do the job for +1 status, refusal gets a -2 status.

### Downtime Activities

* We were upgraded to Tier 1.
* Alabama overindulged and is out of the next adventure.
* Alabama also "acquired" OYO, bringing him into the group.
* OYO has -1d on Insight due to a Level 2 harm to his AI brain (minicomputer).
