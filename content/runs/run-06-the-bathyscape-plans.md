## Run Details

### The Plan

**Social** - We've come to party, oh, and we'll just take these bathyscape plans (Or is it a bathysphere? We don't really know the difference.)

Our mission was to pose as dealers (which is easy, because that's what we are!) going to visit [Hightower](../../factions/hightower) to trade. We intend to get the plans to the bathysphere and escape.

Why? Because Pirate Lord Blaine visited us recently and told us we must do a job against either Black Sands or Hightower. (if we refused, we would get -2 Status, but if we accepted and succeed, we get +1 Status). The Pirate Lords want the technical schematics for an underwater craft so they can build one of their own.

### Participants

* [Vanessa Four](../../characters/vanessa) (Todd)
* [Espinoze](../../characters/espinoze) (Matt)
* [Westler](../../characters/westler) (Rob)

### Results

#### Todd's Sparse Notes

* Hightower's hideout is literally a high tower, a huge skyscraper that's been partially torn apart and rebuilt over the years.
* There is a palace at the ground level, and then a War Palace at the 40th floor.
* Our Social plan was based on using Vanessa's ally Nine Cat Nine. He was a good hype man and broadcast our arrival in advance.
* The man known as The Scraplord and his accountants are in charge here. The upper levels are in ruin. There are anti-aircraft guns.
* We went to a party on the 14th floor, at a place called The Glass Ceiling.
* Vanessa used her fine hand terminal to find the R&D section. It's on the 17th floor. But the merchant whose house we are at became suspicious and took the terminal away.
* From the party balcony on 14, Vanessa fired Espinoze's grappling hook gun and the two of us started climbing.
* Meanwhile, Westler, our new Driver, was having great success posing as a local techie.
* Once we got to the balcony, we busted the door open, activating some guard dogs and the scientist, who came to investigate. About that time, other guards had arrived at his front door. 
* Thanks to a flashback, we came prepared for the dogs with some juicy hamburgers. Vanessa threw them out on the balcony and the dogs went for the food instead of us.
* The humans followed the dogs to the balcony, and Espinoze blew them all up with a molotov, as we jumped off the balcony while attached to the rope and grappling hook.
* The scientist, it turned out, was the same guy we saw get kidnapped (?) from the crashed airplane a couple adventures ago. We thought about kidnapping him ourselves, but he got blown up instead.
* The goal was to crash through the windows into the 16th floor, but Vanessa miscalculated and we slammed into a wall on 15, and then fell one floor down, crashing onto the balcony on 14 (maybe the same one where we started, or maybe a different one, we aren't sure).
* We used our radios to sync up with Westler, and met up at the elevator. We all three escaped on the elevator and then on Westler's truck. That got us far enough away to get extracted by our friends.
* The end.


## After the Run

### Payoff

10

### Friction

oh yeah

### Fallout

Hightower didn't quite figure out what happened. The clock for Ryse the Scraplord to piece together that we caused the fire as a distraction to steal the plans ended one piece short.

### Upkeep

yes

### Downtime Activities

This was the end of the "season" both literally and figuratively. Sandy Shores will hunker down for the next several months, growing agave and trying to survive the seasonal storms.
