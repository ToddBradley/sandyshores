## Run Details

### The Plan

**Social** - We've come to party, oh, and we'll just take these bathyscape plans (Or is it a bathysphere? We don't really know the difference.)

Our mission was to pose as dealers (which is easy, because that's what we are!) going to visit [Hightower](../../factions/hightower) to trade. We intend to get the plans to the bathysphere and escape.

Why? Because Pirate Lord Blaine visited us recently and told us we must do a job against either Black Sands or Hightower. (if we refused, we would get -2 Status, but if we accepted and succeed, we get +1 Status). The Pirate Lords want the technical schematics for an underwater craft so they can build one of their own.

### Participants

* [Vanessa Four](../../characters/vanessa) (Todd)
* [Espinoze](../../characters/espinoze) (Matt)
* [Westler](../../characters/westler) (Rob)

### Results

#### Stream of Consciousness Notes from Vanessa Four

* Hightower's hideout is literally a high tower, a huge skyscraper that's been partially torn apart and rebuilt over the years.
* There is a palace at the ground level, and then a War Palace at the 40th floor.
* Our Social plan was based on using my ally Nine Cat Nine. He was a good hype man and broadcast our arrival in advance.
* The man known as The Scraplord and his accountants are in charge here. The upper levels are in ruin. There are anti-aircraft guns.
* We went to a party on the 14th floor, at a place called The Glass Ceiling.
* I used my fine hand terminal to find the R&D section. It's on the 17th floor. But the merchant whose house we are at became suspicious and took the terminal away.
* From the party balcony on 14, I fired Espinoze's grappling hook gun and the two of us started climbing.
* Meanwhile, Westler, our new Driver, was having great success posing as a local techie. He separately got to the 17th floor thanks to lots of schmoozing and fast talk.
* Once Espinoze and I got to the balcony, we busted the door open, activating some guard dogs and the scientist, who came to investigate. About that time, other guards had arrived at his front door. 
* Lucikly, we came prepared for the dogs with some juicy hamburgers. I threw them out on the balcony and the dogs went for the food instead of us.
* The humans followed the dogs to the balcony, and Espinoze blew them all up with a molotov, as we jumped off the balcony while attached to the rope and grappling hook.
* The scientist, it turned out, was the same guy we saw get kidnapped from the crashed airplane a while ago. We thought about kidnapping him ourselves, but we exploded him instead. Espinoze is impulsive that way.
* The goal was to crash through the windows into the 16th floor, but I miscalculated and we slammed into a wall on 15, and then fell one floor down, crashing onto the balcony on 14 (maybe the same one where we started, or maybe a different one, we aren't sure).
* We used our radios to sync up with Westler, and met up at the elevator. We all three escaped on the elevator and then on Westler's truck. That got us far enough away to get extracted by our friends.
* The end.


## After the Run

### Payoff

10

### Friction

oh yeah

### Fallout

Hightower didn't quite figure out what happened. The clock for Ryse the Scraplord to piece together that we caused the fire as a distraction to steal the plans ended one piece short.

### Upkeep

yes

### Downtime Activities

This was the end of the "season" both literally and figuratively. Sandy Shores will hunker down for the next several months, growing agave and trying to survive the seasonal storms.

### Dan's After Mission Report

Leo the Mutant's slanderous rabble-rousing has caused the tribe to take their first Hatred level, resetting friction to zero. Almost every faction is jealous of Sandy Shores success and would like to see them taken down a peg.

The first entanglement is that the tribe is flush with resources and in-tribe theft, hoarding, and squandering have cost 1 supply. The problem could get worse if not dealt with.

The second entanglement is that the Asphalt Jacks attacked the tribe's only claim, the ranch house in the hills, in an attempt to retake it or kill someone important. They failed and the attack was repulsed but repairing the damage and caring for the injured will cost 1 supply. Besides the Schlep's scary dogs, and the ranch house's fortification, what was used to stave off the attack?

#### News from the wasteland

Thunder's Children pulled a major raid on the Legion during the first big Glow Storm. The Legion's losses were severe, and the rad-storm decimated what was left. The disbanded remnants were scattered and some came to Sandy Shores begging for salvation from the storm. If the tribe accepts these seasoned warriors, it will earn 5 ticks on a 20 count cohort clock. The resulting gang would have an extra edge and flaw: Fearsome / Principled. Turning them away may violated the with-holding aid taboo.

The Asphalt Jacks and the Free Radicals teamed up and made a major raid on the town known as Dirty Drink. A heavy toll in kidnapped townspeople was exacted. The town would have been sacked and destroyed if the Ash Lords hadn't intervened.

Rumor has it that the Queen of Hightower personally whipped Lord Martin, the Commander of her palace security forces, with a barbed  cat o' nine tails for allowing intruders to publicly cavort with his soldiers. The backlash of this was a draconian turn in the way scavengers are being treated in the Boneyard.
