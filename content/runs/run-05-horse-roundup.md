## Run Details

### The Plan

The Ape Nation has been sent by the Pirate Lords to persuade us (Sandy Shores) to do a job against the Black Sands or Hightower. If we do the job, we get +1 Status. If we refuse, we get -2 Status.

This will be the last run of the season, before the Glow Fog settles in, making trade impossible.

Pirate Lord Blaine has been escorted by a troupe of apes on horseback, with unique muskets. He is our guest for a while.

Meanwhile, unknown to us, JL-B8, Vanessa's enemy, has been following her. [there's a clock running to trigger his arrival] 

Also, Leo the Mutant, Alabama's enemy, is spreading lies about him. [there's also a clock running for that]


### Participants

* [OYO](../../characters/oyo) (Todd)
* Espinoz the Junker (Matt)
* Dr. Half the Leftover (Scott)

### Results

#### Stream of Consciousness Notes, From Todd

The ultimate job will be to steal bathysphere plans from Hightower so the Pirates can descnd to a deep sea base.

Alabama had a romantic flirting scene with Pirate Lord Blaine. I gave him an armband - a sectoin of an exhaust pipe with a Pontiac symbol. In return he gave me a piranha codpiece. If we succeed getting the bathyscape plans, we will have a "special celebration".

Then the lightning hit, signaling the beginning of the Razor Hail. The thunder spooked the horses of the apes, and they scattered. Some of the apes went in pusuit, but the leader of the apes came to gather us up for help.

There is a giant mantis that hibernates all year between raids, and the lightning triggers it to emerge from the ground, a Tier 2 Event.

The giant mantis (which looks like a D&D ankheg) is attacking the horses.

OYO has been sent by Frog. He joins Commander Hadrian the ape leader, Dr. Half, and Espinose.

Espinose threw a molotov at the mantis, which harmed it but also killed a lower level ape. OYO followed that with a rocket propelled grenade (an anti-vehicle weapon), which blew off some of the mantis' armor.

Then we prepared to deal the final blow. 

Espinose shot the mantis in the leg to make it lose its balance. And Dr. Half reprogrammed my fog lights to make a distracting pattern, so I could ram the mantis off a cliff into an arroyo.

It worked, and the mantis fell to his death! Simultaneously, Espinose passed out. He now has a psychic bond to insects due to part of the mantis being stuck in his heart.

## After the Run

We got 6 supply but had to spend 4 of it, so we only made 2 profit.

During downtime, OYO healed his AI brain and now speaks more like a human instead of a robot.

We started planning the run on Hightower. Our goal is to take Hightower down a notch, but we need to do it in a way that isn't an assault and isn't traceable to us.

So we get our friends who enemies of Hightower to help us. The Iron Maidens will help, as will the Monarchs. But Black Sands will only help a little.

That sets us up for the final run of the season, which will be next game.
