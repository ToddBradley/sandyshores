## Run Details

### The Plan

Plan type: Deception

### Participants

* Schlep the Feral (Michael)
* [Vanessa Four the Leftover](../../characters/vanessa) (Todd)
* Pasteboarder Tut the Shark (Tim)

### Stream of Consciousness Notes, From Todd

* It's 137 years after the fall.
* We chose for the campaign to be Gonzo Level 3.
* Toecutter's mission is to hit the Asphalt Jacks.
* The Monarchs want healthy slaves. Their leader in the plant girl.
* We want to steal from the Asphalt Jacks.
* The fortress has a stone wall and is well defended.
* Kento is an enemy scout, and a hard hitter. It's him and 2-3 others.
* Smoke means fire inside.
* This is a secret hideout that Toecutter found out about.
* There is another group of Asphalt Jacks headed for the secret hideout. I tried to barter Pasteboarder for their assault rifle.
* The plan now is to stage a scene where half of us chase the other half to draw out the people from the hideout.
* We did that, and killed everyone except Kento, who escaped alive.
* Now we have their secret hideout as an additional turf. We will have to defend it.
* It turns out the Monarchs were watching us (the plant lady).
* Plant Lady is a human mutant who is a slave to a Tree Man.
* They will try to take our hideout later.
* Meanwhile we are going to seek out the crash of the flying machine near The Barrens. (that's the next Run)

### Post-game Summary, From Dan

Using a captured armed safari truck, the tribe lured the Jacks out of their fortified hideout, and into a waiting trap. With firebombs and point blank machine gun executions, all were wiped out, except for Kento, a stealthy assassin. 

Against the odds, Schlep held off Kento's vicious knife attacks long enough for the rest of the tribe to catch up and scare him away. And so the Sandy Shores Tribe claims the ranch house, with its independent water supply. 

The tribe was unaware, but the Monarchs watched the battle unfold.


## Downtime

We got a Tier 0 motorcycle.
