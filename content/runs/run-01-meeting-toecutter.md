## Run Details

### The Plan

This was a mini session.

Plan type: Social (???)

### Participants

* [Alabama the Shark](../../characters/alabama) (Todd)
* Espinoz the Junker (Matt)
* Schlep the Feral (Michael)
* Pasteboarder Tut the Shark (Tim)

### Stream of Consciousness Notes, From Todd

* We live in Sandy Shores, an apartment complex on the outskirts of The Boxes. We took it from Legion by force.
* Our tribe are Dealers.
* We grow mutant agave that we make into tequila.
* Our crop failed and we need a replacement irrigation pump to push it.
* We are going to travel to meet a contact to trade our last 5 gallon jerry can of tequila to Crush for a pump.
* Crush's uncle is Buddy the Mariachi, my friend.
* The Ash Lords came and gave a warning that they'll be back in 3 days for supplies and slaves. Toecutter is their leader.
* They also talked about a cult at Blood Gulch.
* We know the Ash Lords claim is Dirty Drink, but not a hideout location.
* I'm thinking of an end-run attack on the Ash Lords, while they are hassling Buddy and Crush.
* Westchester is a friend of the tribe.
* While we were at Crush's place, Toecutter himself and his gang came to our place (Sandy Shores) and warned that they will be back in 2 days for tribute.
* They had 4 motorcycles, and 2 cars.
* Westchester, our friendly mutant, is a traveling merchant mutant who travels in a school bus pulled by a team of beasts with his family.
* Asphalt Jacks are enemy of Ash Lords. They are hated by everyone and are psychos. Both the Asphalt Jacks and the Ash Lords are mobile raiding gangs.
* Next step: the bar - the Dirty Drinnk - in Espinoz' jalopy. It is a dismal place.
* We made an arrangement with Toecutter against the Asphalt Jacks. He gave us info on their stash/hideout, take from the Monarchs.
* Toecutter wants us to go right now.
* Then a thing flew by in the sky and Toecutter's group is gonna pursue. But we sabotaged their bikes.
* First we go after the Asphalt Jacks to rescue the slaves (that's the next run).
* We will stop here.

### Post-game Summary, From Dan

With scarcity looming, the tribe needs to get more supplies. The fate of the tribe depends on a good trade run. After a short trek to a trade meet at a cluster of homesteads, the right supplies are acquired to finish a few projects.

A ruckus breaks the revelry after the successful deal. Some Raiders have roughed up a few local scavs and announced they'll be back. They demand a tribute of supplies (fuel or food) or slaves when they return. The Sandy Shores Tribe made a deal to delay payment, and, their leader, Toecutter had a tip on an Asphalt Jacks payoff to the Monarchs that could be intercepted.

A Conclave flying machine was spotted and seemed to crash somwhere in the deadly, beast-ridden Barrens.


## After the Run

2 rep for out dealing the Ash Lords. 

3 tribe xp.  For dealing, bolstering reputation and contending with higher challenges.

Espinoz 2 xp.  For addressing a challenge with mayhem and expressing beliefs.

Schlep 2XP for expressing beliefs and for expressing vice.

Alabama 2XP for addressing a challenge with negotiation and expressing beliefs.

PLUS 1 XP bribe for skipping the negotions.

The profits of the deal with Crush and Uncle Buddy will pay for the upkeep cost for both missions.

The Ash Lords agree to not raid or take slaves from the Player's Tribe in exchange for 4 supply in Tequila in about a month. However the small tribes are still vulnerable.
