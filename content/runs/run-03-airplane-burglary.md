## Run Details

### The Plan

Plan style: Stealth

#### Information Gathered In Advanced

(from Dan)

This is the information that your tribe collects on the developements at the crash site.

* Hightower, Tier 4, takes the site of the airplane wreckage and recovers one
wounded survivor. They searched for, and recovered a single shipping crate, as well
as specific gear and equipment. They abandoned the rest. Hit their convoy or
infiltrate the Hightower skyscraper.
Very Hard Mission: Capture a tier 3 expert, a tier 4 tech claim, up to 10 supply in tier
3 gear. Your tribe doesnt know that the wounded mad scientist and his Opus
Delirium in the crate will be transported to the Conclave because there is a secret
alliance between the two. Thier will be other chances to take this claim.

* Knight riders, Tier 3, recover 2 paratrooper vehicles, a cargo drop, and hold the tail
fuselage. Hit them after they pass the cargo drop to Big Red, while they're stripping
the tail section.
Hard Mission: Tier 3 vehicle claims and 6 supply.
Easy mission: Big Red took the cargo drop worth 6 supply.

* The Glassed, Tier 3, got in for high-end salvage from the main fuselage in a well
timed smash and grab, and got away. Intercept thier convoy before they get to the
bunker.
Normal to Hard Mission: 8 supply and a tier 3 tech claim.

* The Legion, Tier 1, ended up with heavy payout for guard duty,
Normal Mission: 8 supply plus tier 1 vehicle claims.

* The Last Calvary, Tier 4, took the main crash site after Hightower Left, They decided
to hold the main fuselage and left the Boneyard Bulldogs, Tier 2, to defend it.
Normal mission: 6 supply, plus Bulldog assets, and take the salvage income claim.

* Sheltered, Tier 2, teamed with the Black Top Society, Tier 1, managed to steal a little
salvage before being routed. Poor salvage take, some wounded. Normal Mission:
Tier 2 vehicle claim and 6 supply.

### Participants

* [Vanessa Four the Leftover](../../characters/vanessa) (Todd)
* Brodie the Reaper (Matt)
* Dr. Half the Leftover (Scott)

### Stream of Consciousness Notes, From Todd

* We created some new characters. I made **Vanessa Four**, escapee from The Domed City. 
	* Her contacts are:
		* ⬇ JL-B8, a replicant - double crossing member of the Runner's underground railroad
		* ⬆ Nine Cat Nine, a radio voice - radio broadcaster to aid runners and the Order of the Ankh
	* History:
		* escaped the domed city
		* pursued by JL-B8 and helped by Nine Cat Nine
		* taken in by Sandy Shores
		* now supervises the agave growing


* Our plan is Stealth to sneak into the crashed aircraft. We are getting a ride from Frog the Driver.
* We are sneaking in while Knight Riders are salvaging, after their fight. Our engagement roll got one 6, so it was successful.
* We found 1 tier-2 tech claim and 1 tier-3 tech claim, 8 general supplies, 1 tier-3 tech claim (RF jammer)
* We learned that the airplane belonged to the Conclave, who is in with Hightower.
* Brodie is pretending to be Joe Namath and succeeding.
* We got a bunch of stuff and need to leave.
* **Flashback**: We brought a side of bison meat with us and put it on the roof of the airplane.
* **Plan**: When I detect wolves approaching, I will put the meat on Joe Namath, who is on the ejection seat. Then I will fire it and then tell Frog to pick us up on the other side of the crashed airplane.
* 1st roll = Finesse to make a big distraction. I took a devil's bargain to start a clock of Glow Wolf retaliation.
* 2nd roll = Prowl to get us to the extraction point.
* 3rd roll = Trek to get home. We were caught in some intelligent branches on the way home, but broke through.
* Mission accomplished!


### Post-game Summary, From Dan

Shortly after the raiding party had set out to hit the Jacks, A second group set out for the airplane crash in the Barrens. After surveying the mass combat that rose up at the wreckage site, they decide on a stealthy burglary of the main fuselage of the downed airplane while a tough faction, called the Boneyard Bulldogs,were busy defended the wreckage site from multiple militant factions.

The run was very successful and the tribe got away during a strange wave of attacks of huge glowing wolves that seemed to spread a horrible mutating mist everywhere.

The Glow Wolves are destined to cross your paths once again, but who could know what unfathomable plans they could have for the sacrificial offering, Jo Nameth the artillery boss, that you sent to drop out of the sky. When Jo returns to the Bulldogs with strange tales, will he be the same? Do the Glow Wolves plan vengeance for you poisoning them with a trickery of a meat offering.

#### The Monarchs Deal

The first trading deal is brokered, human family luxuries for medicines, and fine produce.

## After the Run

* I'm lose in vice (unplayable) for one mission due to overindulgence. But at least I have no stress.
* The tree people came to visib. There isa. lynx in the boss tree's branches. We made a trade agreement with them. We gave them 5 supplies for friendship and will trade 1 supply for 1 supply (fruits for clothes, which they will use to clothe their human slaves).
