## Character Details

* Character Name: OYO - [PDF](<OYO the Driver - playbook.pdf>)
* Player Name: Todd Bradley
* Playbook: Driver
* Look: 2021 Toyota Tundra, heavily modified
* Background: Relic from a lost age
* Taboo: Murder - cannot harm humans except in self-defense
* Deals with vice through Duty: Quasi-religious connection to an orbiting military AI

Has two bodies - a heavily modified pickup truck and a small rover bot, both connected by redundant wireless systems, and in occasional communication with a rogue AI in orbit.


### Hooks

* Enemy: Ginormous, a warboss. Ginormous is the guardian of a secret military base where I was housed for decades, and eventually escaped. If he ever spots me, he will try to bring me back to the base, dead or alive.
* Friend: Dallas, a deathracer. Dallas was a member of the group that infiltrated the base and released several autonomous vehicles. While my higher functions were rebooting, he was my driver for several months. But we parted ways amicably.
* Think of how HAL-9000 was in touch with Dave Bowman / Star Child at the end of 2010. That is how I am in touch with LUDO-IV, the AI. I don’t understand how we communicate, or its intentions. It’s so far advanced that I can’t even comprehend its motives. The relationship is best described in human terms as a worshipper and his god.
