## Overview

Sandy Shores is the faction of the player characters. Its base of operations is an old two-story apartment complex. The first floor - and occasionally the second floor - units are now buried under sand.

We grow agave and distill tequila from it, which we trade to other factions for things we need.


## Current Status

Tier: 1


## Claims

* Sandy Shores - a partially buried apartment complex and farm
* The Ranch House - a secret hideout formerly owned by the Asphalt Jacks
